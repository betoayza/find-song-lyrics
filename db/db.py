Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called Yellow

Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know
You know I love you so?
You know I love you so?

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
Cause you were all yellow

I drew a line

(Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you)

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?

Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh, oh, oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Answer the phone
Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?

Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh, oh, oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

You know it's not the same as it was

    4: """DO I WANNA KNOW
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week

How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

So, have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp
Of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you (crawling back to you)
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (You've had a few?)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy)
Busy being yours (being yours)
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

(Do I wanna know)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay

Too busy being yours to fall

Ever thought of calling, darling?

Do you want me crawling back to you?

    5: """DUELES
Cuando estabas junto a mí
Nuestra luz era celestial
Qué más podía pedir
Encontré la felicidad

Sin aviso
Nuestro paraíso nos dejó
Y ahora tu recuerdo
Me hace sombra al corazón

Hoy se cumple un mes que ya no me ves
Te fuiste, nada más
Quisiste renunciar a quererme
Y cómo dueles

Mientras pienso en ti y en lo que perdí
Quisiera evitar
Haberme permitido amarte
Para perderte

Y me dueles
Cómo dueles

Los golpes en la piel
Dejan marca y después se van
Se van, se van, se van

Pero me rompiste en dos
Y no encuentro reparación

Sin aviso
Nuestro paraíso nos dejó
Y ahora tu recuerdo
Me hace sombra al corazón

Hoy se cumple un mes que ya no me ves
Te fuiste, nada más
Quisiste renunciar a quererme
Y cómo dueles

Mientras pienso en ti y en lo que perdí
Quisiera evitar
Haberme permitido amarte
Para perderte

Y me dueles
Cómo dueles

Ve a ser libre y a ser feliz
Ya da lo mismo aquí
Amigos o alguien que conocí
Sé un extraño y el dolor dejemos ir

Hoy se cumple un mes que ya no me ves
Te fuiste, nada más
Quisiste renunciar a quererme
Y me dueles, dueles, dueles

Mientras pienso en ti y en lo que perdí
Quisiera evitar
Haberme permitido amarte
Y no sabes cuánto dueles

Dueles

Me dueles

    7: """PHOTOGRAPH
Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know, it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So, you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
And you won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And is the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in this photograph

Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So, you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
And you won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's okay, baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

So you could fit me
Inside the necklace you got
When you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home\n""",

Cuando por las noches recordaba todo
El olor de aquel perfume, sobre todo
Las sábanas blancas donde te escondías dentro

Eres intocable como joya de oro
Esas piernas largas, comerme yo solo
Y tus ojos grandes, me perdí en un laberinto

Y pensar
Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito, me dejarás

Intentar
Solo un beso y tú te vas
De mi vida
Cómo tú, no hay nadie más
No hay nadie más

¡Ah!
¿Y qué?

Si te sientes sola, no me llames, porfa
Me pongo sensible e imagino tu sombra
Clase Azul es el tequila e, interior, la ropa

Clicquot la champaña, el polvo es color rosa
Me contactó un ángel, eres tú, mi hermosa
La que me alegra los días y sigo tomando

Y pensar
Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito, me dejarás

Intentar
Solo un beso y tú te vas
De mi vida
Cómo tú, no hay nadie más
No hay nadie más\n""",

Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings

In backyards
Winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

So here you are
Two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far

But turn around (turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you, it's a showdown (showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah, you've got something they don't

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open (keep your ey-eyes open)
Keep your ey-eyes open (keep your ey-eyes open)
